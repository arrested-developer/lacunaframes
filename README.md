## The brief

The client wanted the layout to resemble a frame, which would rotate to show different sections of information about his business. As the frame rotates, the content stretches - a visual metaphor for his craft.

## The challenges

- Creating intuitive UX with an unconventional layout.
- Using semantic HTML for accessibility, but presenting the user with a very different visual layout.
- Responsive design across devices
- Smooth scrolling (rotating) between sections.
- Making the text grow and shrink with the rotation.
- Configuring Webpack with Sass.
